Paper B11-3 is published in 2019 in American Journal of Mathematics (among top 5 mathematical journals in US). In this paper, the framework of Double Operator Integrals playing the crucial role in this project is developed.
Paper B11-2 (written in collaboration with Fields laureate Alain Connes) is published in 2017. In this paper, we developed the interplay between the action of groups and the Quantised Calculus.
Paper B11-1 is published in 2019 in Mathematische Annalen (one of the best European journals). In this paper, the framework of the principal symbol is developed.
Paper B11-4 is published in 2020 in Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society (the best journal in the UK)). Estimates designed in that paper allow to transfer the  methods designed for compact non-commutative spaces into non-compact ones.
Paper B11-7 is published in 2022 in Letters in Mathematical Physics (one of the leading journals in Mathematical Physics). Asymptotic methods developed in this paper will be heavily used in this project.
Paper B11-10 is published in 2020 in Communications in Mathematical Physics (the best journal in Mathematical Physics). This paper demonstrates the applicability of the CI's approach to the density of states (the central theme in Solid State Physics).
